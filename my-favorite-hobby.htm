<h1>My favorite hobby is gaming</h1>

<p>Some of my favorite games are ones that make me feel challenged</p>
<p>Gaming is for everyone. You just need to try different games to start seeing which genre you like.</p>
<p>Watching other people play the game can also help you decide whether or not you are interested in a specific game.</p>
<p>I wouldn't call this an accomplishment, but one of the best memories I had in gaming was winning a smackdown vs raw tournament against all my cousins at a family reunion</p>
