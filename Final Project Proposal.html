    <p>I am the only one working on this project</P>
    <p>This proposal was last updated on 11/8/2020</p>
    <p>This project will be a sound board that will play different sound files</p>
    <p>The user will be able to click a button and the file assigned to that button will play</p>
    <p>I would also like the user to be able to upload their own mp3 files and play them as well, though this might not be implemented yet</P>
    <p>This is an html project</p>
    <p>For the most part, this project is me practicing webpage design and layout using what we learned from the html tutorials</p>
    <p>We have not messed with sound files nor directly uploading files in this class</p>
